class InputMediaVideo(InputMedia):
    """A video to be sent inside an album.
    It is intended to be used with :obj:`~pyrogram.Client.send_media_group`.

    Parameters:
        media (``str``):
            Video to send.
            Pass a file_id as string to send a video that exists on the Telegram servers or
            pass a file path as string to upload a new video that exists on your local machine.
            Sending video by a URL is currently unsupported.

        thumb (``str``):
            Thumbnail of the video sent.
            The thumbnail should be in JPEG format and less than 200 KB in size.
            A thumbnail's width and height should not exceed 320 pixels.
            Thumbnails can't be reused and can be only uploaded as a new file.

        caption (``str``, *optional*):
            Caption of the video to be sent, 0-1024 characters

        parse_mode (``str``, *optional*):
            By default, texts are parsed using both Markdown and HTML styles.
            You can combine both syntaxes together.
            Pass "markdown" or "md" to enable Markdown-style parsing only.
            Pass "html" to enable HTML-style parsing only.
            Pass None to completely disable style parsing.

        caption_entities (List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.MessageEntity`):
            List of special entities that appear in the caption, which can be specified instead of *parse_mode*.

        width (``int``, *optional*):
            Video width.

        height (``int``, *optional*):
            Video height.

        duration (``int``, *optional*):
            Video duration.

        supports_streaming (``bool``, *optional*):
            Pass True, if the uploaded video is suitable for streaming.
