    Parameters:
        media (``str``):
            Video to send.
            Pass a file_id as string to send a video that exists on the Telegram servers or
            pass a file path as string to upload a new video that exists on your local machine.
            Sending video by a URL is currently unsupported.

        file_ref (``str``, *optional*):
            A valid file reference obtained by a recently fetched media message.
            To be used in combination with a file id in case a file reference is needed.

        thumb (``str``):
            Thumbnail of the video sent.
            The thumbnail should be in JPEG format and less than 200 KB in size.

            Pass "markdown" or "md" to enable Markdown-style parsing only.
            Pass "html" to enable HTML-style parsing only.
            Pass None to completely disable style parsing.
