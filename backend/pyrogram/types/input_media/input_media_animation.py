class InputMediaAnimation(InputMedia):
    """An animation file (GIF or H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video without sound) to be sent inside an album.

    Parameters:
        media (``str``):
            Animation to send.
            Pass a file_id as string to send a file that exists on the Telegram servers or

        thumb (``str``, *optional*):
            Thumbnail of the animation file sent.
            The thumbnail should be in JPEG format and less than 200 KB in size.
            A thumbnail's width and height should not exceed 320 pixels.
            Thumbnails can't be reused and can be only uploaded as a new file.

            Pass "html" to enable HTML-style parsing only.
            Pass None to completely disable style parsing.
