        This method connects the client to Telegram and, in case of new sessions, automatically manages the full
        authorization process using an interactive prompt.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.Client`: The started client itself.

        Raises:
            ConnectionError: In case you try to start an already started client.
