        """Iterate through a user's dialogs sequentially.

        This convenience method does the same as repeatedly calling :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.get_dialogs` in a loop,
        thus saving you from the hassle of setting up boilerplate code. It is useful for getting the whole dialogs list
        with a single call.

        Parameters:
            limit (``int``, *optional*):
                Limits the number of dialogs to be retrieved.
                By default, no limit is applied and all dialogs are returned.

            offset_date (``int``):
                The offset date in Unix time taken from the top message of a :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Dialog`.
                Defaults to 0 (most recent dialog).

        Returns:
            ``Generator``: A generator yielding :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Dialog` objects.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # Iterate through all dialogs
                for dialog in app.iter_dialogs():
                    print(dialog.chat.first_name or dialog.chat.title)
        """
        current = 0

        limit = min(100, total)

        pinned_dialogs = await self.get_dialogs(
            pinned_only=True

        for dialog in pinned_dialogs:
            yield dialog

            current += 1

                offset_date=offset_date,
                limit=limit
            )

            if not dialogs:
                return

            offset_date = dialogs[-1].top_message.date
