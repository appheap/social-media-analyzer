        You must be an administrator in the chat for this to work and must have the "can_pin_messages" admin right in
        the supergroup or "can_edit_messages" admin right in the channel.

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.

            message_id (``int``):
                Identifier of a message to pin.

            disable_notification (``bool``):
                Pass True, if it is not necessary to send a notification to all chat members about the new pinned
                message. Notifications are always disabled in channels.

        Returns:
            ``bool``: True on success.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # Pin with notification
                app.pin_chat_message(chat_id, message_id)
