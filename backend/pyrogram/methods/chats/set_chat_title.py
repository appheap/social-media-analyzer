        Titles can't be changed for private chats.
        You must be an administrator in the chat for this to work and must have the appropriate admin rights.

        Note:
            In regular groups (non-supergroups), this method will only work if the "All Members Are Admins"
            setting is off.

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.

            title (``str``):
                New chat title, 1-255 characters.

        Returns:
            ``bool``: True on success.

        Raises:
            ValueError: In case a chat id belongs to user.

        Example:
