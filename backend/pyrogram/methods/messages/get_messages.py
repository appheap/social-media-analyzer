    async def get_messages(
            self,
            chat_id: Union[int, str],
            message_ids: Union[int, Iterable[int]] = None,

        """Get one or more messages from a chat by using message identifiers.

        You can retrieve up to 200 messages at once.

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            message_ids (``iterable``, *optional*):
                Pass a single message identifier or a list of message ids (as integers) to get the content of the
                message themselves. Iterators and Generators are also accepted.

            reply_to_message_ids (``iterable``, *optional*):
                Pass a single message identifier or a list of message ids (as integers) to get the content of
                the previous message you replied to using this message. Iterators and Generators are also accepted.
                If *message_ids* is set, this argument will be ignored.

            replies (``int``, *optional*):
                The number of subsequent replies to get for each message.
                Pass 0 for no reply at all or -1 for unlimited replies.
                Defaults to 1.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message` | List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message`: In case *message_ids* was an
            integer, the single requested message is returned, otherwise, in case *message_ids* was an iterable, the
            returned value will be a list of messages, even if such iterable contained just a single element.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # Get one message
                app.get_messages("pyrogramchat", 51110)

                # Get more than one message (list of messages)
                app.get_messages("pyrogramchat", [44625, 51110])

                # Get message by ignoring any replied-to message
                app.get_messages(chat_id, message_id, replies=0)

                # Get message with all chained replied-to messages
                app.get_messages(chat_id, message_id, replies=-1)

                # Get the replied-to message of a message
                app.get_messages(chat_id, reply_to_message_ids=message_id)
