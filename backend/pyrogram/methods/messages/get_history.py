        """Retrieve a chunk of the history of a chat.

        You can get up to 100 messages at once.
        For a more convenient way of getting a chat history see :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.iter_history`.

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            limit (``int``, *optional*):
                Limits the number of messages to be retrieved.
                By default, the first 100 messages are returned.

            offset (``int``, *optional*):
                Sequential number of the first message to be returned. Defaults to 0 (most recent message).
                Negative values are also accepted and become useful in case you set offset_id or offset_date.

            offset_id (``int``, *optional*):
                Pass a message identifier as offset to retrieve only older messages starting from that message.

            offset_date (``int``, *optional*):
                Pass a date in Unix time as offset to retrieve only older messages starting from that date.

            reverse (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True to retrieve the messages in reversed order (from older to most recent).

        Returns:
            List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message` - On success, a list of the retrieved messages is returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # Get the last 100 messages of a chat
                app.get_history("pyrogramchat")

                # Get the last 3 messages of a chat
                app.get_history("pyrogramchat", limit=3)

                # Get 3 messages after skipping the first 5
                app.get_history("pyrogramchat", offset=5, limit=3)
