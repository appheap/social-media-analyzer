        """Search messages globally from all of your chats.

        .. note::

            Due to server-side limitations, you can only get up to around ~10,000 messages and each message
            retrieved will not have any *reply_to_message* field.

        Parameters:
            query (``str``):
                Text query string.

            limit (``int``, *optional*):
                Limits the number of messages to be retrieved.
                By default, no limit is applied and all messages are returned.

        Returns:
            ``Generator``: A generator yielding :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message` objects.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # Search for "pyrogram". Get the first 420 results
                for message in app.search_global("pyrogram", limit=420):
