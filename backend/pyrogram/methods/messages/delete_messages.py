        """Delete messages, including service messages.

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            message_ids (``int`` | ``Iterable[int]``):
                A list of Message identifiers to delete (integers) or a single message id.
                Iterators and Generators are also accepted.

            revoke (``bool``, *optional*):
                Deletes messages on both parts.
                This is only for private cloud chats and normal groups, messages on
                channels and supergroups are always revoked (i.e.: deleted for everyone).
                Defaults to True.

        Returns:
            ``bool``: True on success, False otherwise.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # Delete one message
                app.delete_messages(chat_id, message_id)
