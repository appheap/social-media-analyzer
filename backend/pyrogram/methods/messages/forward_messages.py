        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            from_chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the source chat where the original message was sent.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            message_ids (``int`` | List of ``int``):
                A list of Message identifiers in the chat specified in *from_chat_id* or a single message id.
                Iterators and Generators are also accepted.

            disable_notification (``bool``, *optional*):
                Sends the message silently.
                Users will receive a notification with no sound.

            schedule_date (``int``, *optional*):
                Date when the message will be automatically sent. Unix time.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message` | List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message`: In case *message_ids* was an
            integer, the single forwarded message is returned, otherwise, in case *message_ids* was an iterable,
            the returned value will be a list of messages, even if such iterable contained just a single element.
