        """Get a list of profile pictures for a user or a chat.

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            offset (``int``, *optional*):
                Sequential number of the first photo to be returned.
                By default, all photos are returned.

            limit (``int``, *optional*):
                Limits the number of photos to be retrieved.
                Values between 1â€”100 are accepted. Defaults to 100.

        Returns:
            List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Photo`: On success, a list of profile photos is returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # Get the first 100 profile photos of a user
                app.get_profile_photos("haskell")
