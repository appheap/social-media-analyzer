        This method only works for users, not bots. Bot usernames must be changed via Bot Support or by recreating
        them from scratch using BotFather. To update a channel or supergroup username you can use
        :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.update_chat_username`.

        Parameters:
            username (``str`` | ``None``):
                Username to set. "" (empty string) or None to remove it.

        Returns:
            ``bool``: True on success.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                app.update_username("new_username")
        """

        return bool(
            await self.send(
                raw.functions.account.UpdateUsername(
                    username=username or ""
                )
