        """Get information about a user.
        You can retrieve up to 200 users at once.

        Parameters:
            user_ids (``iterable``):
                A list of User identifiers (id or username) or a single user id/username.
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).
                Iterators and Generators are also accepted.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.User` | List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.User`: In case *user_ids* was an integer or
            string the single requested user is returned, otherwise, in case *user_ids* was an iterable a list of users
            is returned, even if the iterable contained one item only.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # Get information about one user
                app.get_users("haskell")

                # Get information about multiple users at once
                app.get_users([user1, user2, user3])
